# 📄 Analyzing Wikipedia Pages (Simplified `grep` in Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of a guided exercise where I implemented a simplified version of the `grep` command‑line utility in Python to search through raw HTML files scraped from Wikipedia.

The dataset contains **54MB of Wikipedia article files** stored in a `wiki` folder.  
The goal was to:
- ✅ List and iterate through all HTML files.
- ✅ Read and explore the content of each file.
- ✅ Implement a text search across all files.
- ✅ Add a case‑insensitive search option.
- ✅ Display search results along with file names and positions.

## ✨ Key Achievements
✔️ Successfully processed and searched across 54MB of raw HTML data.  
✔️ Implemented efficient string search functionality with both **case‑sensitive** and **case‑insensitive** options.  
✔️ Demonstrated ability to handle unstructured data using Python’s built‑in libraries (`os`, file handling, string manipulation).
